# Homelab Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to my homelab setup! This environment leverages Proxmox for virtualization and Kubernetes (k8s) for container orchestration, 
both configured for high availability (HA) to ensure resilience and uptime. This README provides an overview on how to navigate this repo.

### hardware.md
- Specifies all the hardware currently running in the lab.

### proxmox-setup.md
- This document outlines the Proxmox VE setup, reasons for HA, virtual machines, containers, storage etc.

### jenkins-pipeline-example.md
- Showcases one of my pipelines written in Groovy, with the purpose of deploying an application to the k8s-cluster via Jenkins.
